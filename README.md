### Repository Name: Face-Detection-OpenCV

#### Description:
This repository contains a simple Python script using the OpenCV library for real-time face detection from a webcam feed. The script uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in each frame captured from the webcam.

#### Features:
- Real-time face detection.
- Drawing rectangles around detected faces.
- Easy integration with webcam or video file.

#### Requirements:
- Python
- OpenCV

#### Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Face-Detection-OpenCV.git
    cd Face-Detection-OpenCV
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

3. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python face_detection.py
    ```

4. Press 'q' to exit the application.

#### Customization:
- You can customize the script by adjusting parameters such as the webcam index, Haar Cascade classifier file path, and detection parameters.

#### Credits:
This project is based on the OpenCV library and the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.
